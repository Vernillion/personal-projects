StacksAndArrays is a C++ project I did in my CIS-277 course, it presents the user with a menu including different actions and asks the user for a certain number of inputs to put into the stack.

The matrixProject is another one of my C++ projects from my CIS-277 course. It asks the user for a certain number of input values and then presents the user with different arithmetic operations. 
The code then outputs the results in a matrix format.
